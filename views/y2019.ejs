            A new benzothiazole derivative, benzothiazol-2-yl-malonaldehyde (BTM) was synthesized and its biological potency has been investigated in terms of its anti-bacterial activity. Its interaction with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and DNA cleavage studies were also carried out. The interaction between BSA and BTM was studied by multi-spectroscopic approach, which included spectrofluorimetry, CD spctrophotometry and FTIR. The experiments were carried out at three different temperatures and the quenching mechanism was observed to be both static as well as dynamic. The binding was found to be moderate as evident by its binding constant values (of the order of 10³). A single binding site was observed and site marker experiments showed site III of BSA for BTM. The negative values of ΔG⁰ suggested the spontaneity of the interaction and positive values for both ΔH⁰ and ΔS⁰ indicated that the nature of interaction was hydrophobic. The CD and FTIR studies revealed that the secondary structure of BSA has been altered upon binding of BTM. BTM cleaved the super-coiled DNA in the presence and absence of hydrogen peroxide at micro-molar concentration. It was also found from the antibacterial activity that BTM showed better activity against gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa than the other bacterial stains used for the study.

            The detection of the medicinal plant, Andrographis paniculata (AP) has been carried out through the proboscis extension reflex of honeybees. The technique employed for the training of honeybees is the classical Pavlovian conditioning. The honey bees were exposed to the scents of the leaves of AP, with sugar solution as a reward for it. It was observed that honeybees responded well to the odors of AP. It was noticed that honeybees were able to memorize the odor(s) for a noticeable period of time which is evident by the repeated experiments carried out in the next day. This study suggests that honeybees have the capability to detect and differentiate the natural plants also upon their training. The proposed study is useful in identifying the plant material adulteration in ayurvedic medicinal industries.

            A new heterocyclic compound, 5,6-Dihydroimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-2-carbaldehyde (ITC) was synthesized and its antibacterial activity and also its interaction with bovine serum albumin (BSA) were studied. The structure of the synthesized compound was confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and IR spectroscopic techniques. The antibacterial activity was carried out by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. The compound showed a good antibacterial activity. The mechanism of interaction between the BSA and ITC under physiological conditions was investigated by various molecular spectroscopic techniques like, fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), UV absorption and FT-IR. The interaction between ITC and BSA was followed by studying the quenching of intrinsic fluorescence of BSA upon the addition of ITC at three different temperatures. The binding constant (K), Stern-Volmer quenching constant (Ksv) and number of binding sites were determined. The separation distance between BSA and ITC was evaluated based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer theory. The conformational changes in BSA upon binding of ITC were also confirmed. The interference of some metal ions on interaction was studies. The displacement studies with site specific markers confirm that the site III was the binding site for ITC on BSA.

            Objective: The objective of the present work was to develop and validate a simple, sensitive, rapid and stable reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method for a combination of Terbutaline sulphate (TSL), Ambroxol hydrochloride (AML) and Guaifenesin (GFN). Method: The combination of these drugs was analyzed by using Shimadzu LC 2010 CHT high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Successful separation was achieved by isocratic elution on a reverse-phase C18 column (sun fire) (250mm, 4.6mm, 5μ), using a mobile phase consisting of buffer: acetonitrile in the ratio 80: 20 (buffer - 0.1% v/v triethyleamine pH-3.0) followed by 1.0mL/min flow rate. The wavelength of detection was at 220nm. Result: The chromatographic retention times were consistent at 3.0, 10.5 and 13.8minutes for TSL, AML and GFN respectively. For these three compounds, the lower limit of detection was 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5μg/mL and lower limit of quantification was 3.3, 4.1 and 5.0μg/mL respectively. The linearity concentrations established for TSL, AML and GFN were 1.0-7.0, 1.5-7.5 and 4.0-14.0μg/mL respectively. The correlation coefficients for all the drugs were found to be greater than 0.999. The relative standard deviation of inter- and intra-day were less than 2.0%. Conclusion: This method provides a necessary tool for quantification of the selected drugs for their assay. The proposed method is simple, accurate, reproducible and applied successfully to analyze three compounds in pure as well dosage form.
