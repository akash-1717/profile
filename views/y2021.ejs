                Inducing the bio-functionalization in noble metal nanoparticles like gold, silver, zinc is very important to accomplish their biocompatibility in biological activities. These metal nanoparticles are being rigorously used in bio-sensing tools keeping their remarkable properties in mind. Amongst the serum albumins, the most ample proteins in plasma are bovine serum albumin and human serum albumin. A broad variety of physiological functions of bovine serum albumin has made it a model protein for bio-functionalization. In the present study, ZnO/Ag nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized by SEM and XRD techniques and the interaction between bovine serum albumin and ZnO/Ag nanoparticles was evaluated by employing ultra-violet, steady state fluorescence, circular dichroism and FTIR spectroscopic techniques. Upon the excitation of bovine serum albumin, ZnO/Ag nanoparticles appreciably reduced the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of bovine serum albumin. The number of binding locations and apparent binding constants at different temperatures were calculated by the fluorescence quenching method. Static mechanism of quenching and conformational modifications in bovine serum albumin were also found. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

                Background Cancer disease is making a serious concern globally. Global cancer occurrence is steadily increasing every year. There is always a persistent need to develop new anticancer drugs with reduced side effects or act synergistically with the existing chemotherapeutics. Objective Benzoxazoles are fused bicyclic nitrogen and oxygen-containing heterocyclic compounds and are considered biologically privileged scaffolds. We designed a synthetic route to link the benzoxazoles with oxadiazoles resulting in a better pharmacophore for anticancer activity. Methods A series of novel amide derivatives of benzoxazole linked 1,3,4-oxadiazoles (10a-j) were synthesized and characterized by ¹ H NMR, ¹³ C NMR, and mass spectroscopic techniques. The biological properties of the compounds were screened in vitro against four different tumor cell lines. Results The results suggest that the compound 10b having 3,4,5-trimethoxy substitution on the phenyl ring exhibited potent anticancer activity in three cell lines (A549 = 0.13 ± 0.014 µM, MCF-7 = 0.10 ± 0.013 µM and HT-29 = 0.22 ± 0.017 µM). Notably, among the synthesized derivatives, compounds 10b, 10c, 10f, 10g, and 10i exhibited potent anticancer activity than the control IC 50 in the range of 0.11 ± 0.02 to 0.93 ± 0.034 µM. Molecular docking simulation results showed compounds were stabilized by hydrogen bond and π-π interactions with the protein. Conclusion The molecules showed comparable binding affinities with standard Combretastatin-A4. The present research work is preliminary and needs further studies to take the synthesized compounds to the next level in the cancer research field.

                Objectives: Simple, novel and selective RP-HPLC and UV spectroscopic methods have been developed and optimized for the determination of remogliflozin etabonate (RMZ) in bulk and dosage forms. Materials and Methods: In HPLC method, the principal peak and internal standard peak were eluted separately at different retention times with the chromatographic conditions such as, mobile phase consists of 0.02 M ammonium acetate buffer (pH was adjusted to 4.0 by 1.0 M ortho phosphoric acid), acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran (THF) in the ratio 50:45:05, respectively (v/v) and the stationary phase used was C18, 5 μ.m, 4.6 mm x 250 mm Kromasil column. The flow rate was 2.0 mLmin-1, sample injection volume was 10 μL and the wavelength of detection was fixed at 228 nm. In case UV spectroscopic method, the RMZ was diluted with pure ethanol. The RMZ showed maximum absorbance at 228nm. Hence throughout analysis 228 nm was used for the determination of RMZ. Results: The retention times of RMZ and internal standard, atorvastatin (ATST) were 6.2 min and 7.0 min, respectively. The resolution between the peaks was found to be more than 2.0. The total run time was fixed at 10 minutes. The linearity range for RP-HPLC method was found to be 10 µgmL-1 to 50 µgmL-1, at a fixed concentration of ATST. The linearity range for the UV spectroscopic method was found to be in the range of 100 to 250 µgmL-1. Regression coefficients (R2) were found above 0.999 for both the techniques. The limit of detection and limit of quantification for RMZ were found to be 1.0 µgmL-1 and 3.5 µgmL-1 respectively, in RP-HPLC method and 10.0 µgmL1and 40 µgmL-1,respectively in UV spectroscopic method. Conclusion: The developed methods were found to be simple, accurate, reproducible and precise. The RMZ can be analyzed in dual techniques, i.e., chromatographic as well as UV spectroscopic methods for its routine analysis.
